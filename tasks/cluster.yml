# Play to prepare instance to install RabbitMQ on itself when bootet. Setting it up for clustering.
# RabbitMQ can't be install prior first boot (on an image) as it messes with system state to make later cluster
# setup impossible as hostname changes on a fresh boot on AWS, so setup can't be on the AMI.
